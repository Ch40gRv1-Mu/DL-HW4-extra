We will start by adding a few new ops leveraging our new CPU/CUDA backends. Then, you will implement convolution, and a convolutional neural network to train a classifier on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. Then, you will implement recurrent and long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and do word-level prediction language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset.\n","\n","As always, we will start by copying this notebook and getting the starting code.\n","Reminder: __you must save a copy in drive__."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"usqNjQTQucAO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763015252409,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":8318,"user":{"displayName":"Changrui Mu","userId":"03226529930170103580"}},"outputId":"d2220b98-9a57-4693-aa79-131d67166dfa"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n","/content/drive/MyDrive\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/dl-test/hw4\n","Collecting git+https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git\n","  Cloning https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git to /tmp/pip-req-build-u2r284_t\n","  Running command git clone --filter=blob:none --quiet https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git /tmp/pip-req-build-u2r284_t\n","  Resolved https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git to commit ac73f725eb2ce0e2c6a38fa540035ee970b8b873\n","  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","Requirement already satisfied: pybind11 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (3.0.1)\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/dl-test/hw4\n","\n","!pip3 install --upgrade --no-deps git+https://github.com/dlsys10714/mugrade.git\n","!pip3 install pybind11"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!python -c \"import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)\"\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iURia9MZ2Jo3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763015256831,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4421,"user":{"displayName":"Changrui Mu","userId":"03226529930170103580"}},"outputId":"97107802-950a-45e0-824e-7db6626add81"},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["12.6\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"id":"raU5egHBucAO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763015256846,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Changrui Mu","userId":"03226529930170103580"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# REQUIRED FOR MUGRADE\n","MY_API_KEY = \"<FILL YOUR API KEY HERE>\"\n","HW4_NAME = \"hw4\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"evVgfcOMucAO","outputId":"8b4e01c4-3e51-4265-e5fc-e3c6ecda1dd2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763015282487,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":25640,"user":{"displayName":"Changrui Mu","userId":"03226529930170103580"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/dl-test/hw4\n","\u001b[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):\n","  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of\n","  CMake.\n","\n","  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.

We will try to provide some useful hints here. Basically, we encourage you to make use of the surprising fact that _whatever makes the dimensions work out is typically right_.\n","\n","Ultimately, the backward pass of convolution can be done in terms of the convolution operator itself, with some clever manipulations using `flip`, `dilate`, and multiple applications of `transpose` to both the arguments and the results.\n","\n","In the last section, we essentially implemented convolution as a matrix product: ignoring the various restride and reshape operations, we basically have something like `X @ W`, where `X` is the input and `W` is the weight. We also have `out_grad`, which is the same shape as `X @ W`. Now, you have already implemented the backward pass of matrix multiplication in a previous assignment, and we can use this knowledge to get some insight into the backward pass of convolution. In particular, referencing your matmul backward implementation, you may notice (heuristically speaking here):\n","\n","`X.grad = out_grad @ W.transpose` \\\n","`W.grad = X.transpose @ out_grad`\n","\n","Surprisingly enough, things work out if we just assume that these are also convolutions (and now assuming that `out_grad`, `W`, and `X` are tensors amenable to 2D multi-channel convolution instead of matrices):\n","\n","`X.grad = ≈conv(≈out_grad, ≈W)` \\\n","`W.grad = ≈conv(≈X, ≈out_grad)`\n","\n","In which the \"≈\" indicates that you need to apply some additional operators to these terms in order to get the dimensions to work out, such as permuting/transposing axes, dilating, changing the `padding=` argument to the convolution function, or permuting/transposing axes of the resulting convolution.\n","\n","As we saw on the [last few slides here](https://dlsyscourse.org/slides/conv_nets.pdf) in class, the transpose of a convolution can be found by simply flipping the kernel. Since we're working in 2D instead of 1D, this means flipping the kernel both vertically and horizontally (thus why we implemented `flip`).\n","\n","Summarizing some hints for both `X.grad` and `W.grad`:\n","\n","`X.grad`\n","- The convolution of `out_grad` and `W`, with some operations applied to those\n","- `W` should be flipped over both the kernel dimensions\n","- If the convolution is strided, increase the size of `out_grad` with a corresponding dilation\n","- Do an example to analyze dimensions: note the shape you want for `X.grad`, and think about how you must permute/transpose the arguments and add padding to the convolution to achieve this shape\n","    - This padding depends on both the kernel size and the `padding` argument to the convolution\n","\n","`W.grad`\n","- The convolution of `X` and `out_grad`, with some operations applied to those\n","- The gradients of `W` must be accumulated over the batches; how can you make the conv operator itself do this accumulation?\n","    - Consider turning batches into channels via transpose/permute\n","- Analyze dimensions: how can you modify `X` and `out_grad` so that the shape of their convolution matches the shape of `W`? You may need to transpose/permute the result.\n","    - Remember to account for the `padding` argument passed to convolution\n","\n","General tips\n","- Deal with strided convolutions last (you should be able to just drop in `dilate` when you've passed most of the tests)\n","- Start with the case where `padding=0`, then consider changing `padding` arguments\n","- You can \"permute\" axes with multiple calls to `transpose`\n","\n","It might also be useful to skip ahead to nn.Conv, pass the forward tests, and then use both the tests below and the nn.Conv backward tests to debug your implementation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":38,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"km9rtGwzucAT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763015375392,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":9338,"user":{"displayName":"Changrui
